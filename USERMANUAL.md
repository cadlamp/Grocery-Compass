## How to Report a Bug
To report a bug to the devs, please email us at nickhit3@uw.edu, and make sure to read the following guidelines beforehand:

1. First, check to see if you have the current version of the software. There's a chance that if the bug was prevalent for other users, we've already fixed it!
2. If the bug isn't fixed, start by providing a concise summary of what the bug is. What was the expected behavior you were looking for? What behavior did you get instead?
3. If the bug is still present, please see if you can reproduce the bug by running the app again and repeating your actions. If possible, consider testing from another device to see if it could potentially be hardware specific. Once you're sure you know the steps that lead to the bug, list them out in your message so that the devs can reproduce it and see for themselves the behaviors you are getting.
4. Be sure to include additional details to help us track down the cause, including the app Version, the OS you are using, the area of the app the bug occurs in (e.g. the Home page vs. the Map page), and anything else you believe could be of use. The more detailed the better!
5. Repeat this process for the remaining bugs you have encountered. Thank you for helping!
